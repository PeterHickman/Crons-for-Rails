Crons
=====

If you have some tasks that need to be run periodically for your
site to function (cron scripts in the unix parlance) then this
plugin will add some tasks to your Rakefile and Capfile to
automate the installation of those scripts when you deploy.

This assumes that you are using a unix like os such as Linux
or OSX and that your cron program understands the paul Vixie
extensions such as @daily, @weekly etc.

Example
=======

In your scripts directory create the following directories

<app>/scripts/crons
              |----/daily
              |----/weekly
              |----/hourly
              |----/monthly

Place the unix shell scripts or Ruby scripts in the appropriate
directories. You can omit directories that you do not require.

The unix shell scripts will be added to the users crontab so:

@daily (/bin/sh /path/to/app/script/crons/daily/db_backup.sh)

The Ruby scripts will be added to the users crontab so:

@daily (cd /path/to/app ; /usr/local/bin/ruby script/runner -e production script/crons/daily/purge_sessions.rb)
